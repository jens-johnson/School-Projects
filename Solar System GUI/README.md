This project is an interactive GUI that utilizes TKinter and reads a text file of planetary information for the solar system and allows the user to visualize their orbits on a canvas, while controlling the number of bodies, time step size, and number of time steps.

*Note: This project was originally created in IPython using Anaconda's Jupyter library, and as such can either be executed in an IPython notebook, a python shell, or from the command line.
