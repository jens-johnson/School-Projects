Tactics and checks for Sudoku.

Author(s): Christopher Johnson
Credit(s): Michal Young and Joe Sventek, University of Oregon

A tactic is a rule that can be used to determine and/or constrain the
possible choices for a Sudoku tile.

A check determines whether a given Sudoku board
(whether complete or incomplete) is legal.  A board is
legal if it contains only digits and open spaces, and
if all of the digits are unique in each row, column,
and 3x3 block.
